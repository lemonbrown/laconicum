## Why this exists

This blog exists to discuss my work on lemonbrown.me, ordo (notification app), and miscellaneous thoughts in my life.
I will discuss my work and findings developing this blog, lemonbrown.me. This site will also be open source, and you can find it 
[here](https://github.com/lemonbrown/laconicum). The site will be broken into two categories: Dev and Life.

I will also discuss my work on Ordo (WIP name), a simple notification application. I plan to describe the entire development
process. Ordo will be open source. 

## About me
I am a software developer, looking to exercise different skills and technologies in Ordo and lemonbrown.me. I am best described as an average developer, without impressive achievements in techonolgy or possessing any education in prostegious programs. Though, I have a curious personality, leading to explore software development.
